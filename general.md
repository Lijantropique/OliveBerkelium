# ICS Visual Novel
January 6th, 2021

# General Objective
Create an interactive novel that allows the user to learn about ICS/SCADA cybersecurity. The novel is intended for educational purposes, but the format and the style hopefully are appealing and fun. If there is a trade off between education and fun, in general the novel should prefer education.

# Team
Development team
* @cutaway
* @workentin
* @virusFriendly
* @sudo
* @lijantropique

# Game Location
International Consumer Soap (ICS) plant.

# Characters
The user will experience the Point of view (PoV) of the following characters:
* A criminal (several types: nation state, common criminal, etc )
* A red teamer? (See note 1 below)
* A SOC analyst
* OT Team member (controls eng or operator)
* A Manager

# Game plot Review
The plant is fictional but the idea is to make the game as realistic and plausible as possible. It must be correct and when possible show good design practices (unless the flaw is part of the plot). Once the team approve the paths and the branches, ideally a 3rd party (org with ICS experience) should review it as a sanity check. At this point the game can start the next phase (development)  

# Schedule
Jan 22  ->  Exploit paths Draft completed: The structure of each adventure must be defined. Branches and twists can be added later but the main procedure must be defined.
Feb 5   ->  First Scenario completed (physical?): Mind map presenting main plot, additional characters needed, relation with the exploit path and consequences. The mind map will be review by the team (2 weeks)
Feb 19  ->  Comments and changes for First Scenario: Comments and adjustments proposed for first scenario would be discussed and voted. 
        ->  Assignments for additional scenarios: based on lessons learn from first scenario, the idea is to start simultaneously the development of the other scenarios.
Mar 19  -> Review other scenarios
Mar 31  -> Basic game concept is completed (Milestone).

# Notes
1. From @cutaway: "Most organizations in OT can't afford true red teaming and aren't even really ready for true pentesting. Even regulated orgs get pentests to check the box. Yes, there are exceptions to the rules, but I don't believe that is the best audience. I feel we are trying to educate OT teams things to do and also educate infosec on good things to do." Red teamer character should be replaced? maybe OT?
