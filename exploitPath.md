# ICS Visual Novel
January 6th, 2021

# Characters
## Offensive Characters
- Criminal
- Red Teamer (White Hat)
- Professional (APT/Nation-State) (maybe? Optional to incorporate this?)
## Defensive Characters 
- SOC Analyst
- Process Engineer
- Factory Management
- Corporate Executive

# Exploit Path
_The ICS Cyber Kill Chain is an alternative to going through the Discovery/Lateral Movement rinse/repeat cycle, although it also incorporates some of that, too._
## Using Traditional Methodology
1. IT Network
	1. Initial Access (Criminal and Professional begin here)
	2. Persistence
	3. Discovery (Red Teamer begins here)
	4. Lateral Movement
2. Supervisory Network
	1. Persistence
	2. Discovery
	3. Lateral Movement (SOC Analyst begins here)
3. OT Network
	1. Persistence
	2. Discovery
	3. Lateral Movement (Factory Management begins here)
4. Device Network
	1. Persistence
	2. Effects (Process Engineer begins here) (Executive begins here)
## Using ICS Cyber Kill Chain Methodology[^1]
1. Stage 1 - Cyber Intrusion Preparation and Execution _Corresponds to Traditional Exploit Path through the IT network and possibly Supervisory Network_
	1. Planning (Professional/APT begins here)
		1. Reconnaisance
	2. Preparation 
		1. Weaponization _I think we could gloss over this and just assume they have an exploit to use_
		2. Targeting  (Criminal begins here) _We could set the scene by talking about why a nation-state actor could be targeting the victim_
	3. Cyber Intrusion
		1. Delivery (Red Teamer begins here)
		2. Exploit
		3. Install/Modify
	4. Management & Enablement
		1. C2 (SOC Analyst begins here)
	5. Sustainment, Entrenchment, Development & Execution
		1. Act (Factory Management begins here)
_We wouldnâ€™t necessarily use all of these_
- Discovery
- Movement
- Install/Execute
- Launch
- Capture
- Collect
- Exfiltrate
- Clean/Defend
1. Stage 2 - ICS Attack Development and Execution
	1. Attack Development & Tuning (Only Professional/APT)
	2. Validation (Test) (Only Professional/APT)
	3. ICS Attack (Process Engineer begins here)
		1. Deliver 
		2. Install/Modify
		3. Execute ICS Attack (Executive begins here)
