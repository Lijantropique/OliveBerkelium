# Game scenarios

<!-- Should we say "missions"? if so, what about defenders? -->

The scenarios should correspond to specific objectives in specific scenarios. Based on player actions, some scenarios are available while other are blocked. The scenarios might or might not have pre-requisites (e.g., other scenario and/or additional info) 

<!-- Should the scenarios be part of a path, should we work on the path first? -->
